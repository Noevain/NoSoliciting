# NoSoliciting

*Adblock for FFXIV.*

## Summary

NoSoliciting filters chat messages and Party Finder listings based on
various built-in and custom filters. The built-in filters are updated
in the `definitions.yaml` file and can be updated without a plugin
update. Custom filters are user-defined and are either
case-insensitive substrings or regular expressions.

All messages and listings filtered are logged in case of false
positives, and there is a reporting mechanism in which users can
report if NoSoliciting had a false positive or a false negative.
