# THIS FILE IS DEPRECATED AND WILL NO LONGER RECEIVE UPDATES. Please
# see the file called data.csv in NoSoliciting.Trainer for how to
# update the new machine learning model that has replaced this file.

# This file defines the filters that NoSoliciting will use for
# built-in filters.

# The version should be incremented for each commit including changes
# to this file.

# There are two main sections: chat and party_finder. The chat and
# party_finder sections are for their respective areas (the chat log
# and the Party Finder window).

# Each subsection is a separate built-in filter that can be toggled on
# and off. The option shown in the UI is defined in the subsection.

# Subsections can have ignore_case (defaults to false) and normalise
# (defaults to true) set. ignore_case will ignore casing for matching
# against the matchers, and normalise will normalise text prior to
# matching. Text normalisation consists of turning FFXIV-specific
# unicode symbols into normal ASCII characters and running a NFKD
# unicode decomposition on the result.

# Subsections also may filter based on channels with the channels key.
# A list of channels may be specified, and the message will be ignored
# if not in one of the specified channels. For the Party Finder, the
# channel is always None. An empty list (or missing channels key) will
# ignore the channel.

# Each subsection may specify whether it is enabled by default with
# the default key. This should be used sparingly. This defaults to
# false.

# The real meat of the file is the matchers. There are two types of
# matchers: required and likely. Both types have categories of strings
# or regular expressions that should match. For required matchers, at
# least one string or regex should match in *all* categories. For
# likely matchers, at least one string or regex should match in the
# value of likelihood_threshold (or greater) categories.

# If both required and likely matchers are specified, they both must
# match. This means that all the categories of the required matchers
# must find a match, *and* that at least likelihood_threshold matchers
# must find a match in likely_matchers.

# Substring matchers are faster than regular expressions and are
# specified just by using a string. Regular expression matchers are
# slower but more flexible, and they are specified by using a regex
# key, as can be seen below.
